log: v2k-log.txt

# Typing mode: how text is output
# - buffered: Wait for natural pauses before typing (more accurate, recommended)
# - realtime: Type words immediately as recognized (faster, less accurate)
mode: buffered

# Pause delay (in seconds) after speech pause before typing
# Gives the model extra time to refine predictions with full context
# Set to 0 to disable. Only applies in buffered mode.
pause: 0.3

# Faster-whisper engine settings (ignored for Vosk models)

# Whisper hallucinations to ignore
# When Whisper is given silence or very short audio, it sometimes generates these
# Add your own if they happen and consider filing an issue with this repo

- You
- Huh
- Okay. Okay. Okay*
